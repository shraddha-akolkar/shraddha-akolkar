Hi, Iâ€™m Shraddha Akolkar, a dedicated and detail-oriented Full-Stack MERN Stack Developer currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA).

I specialize in building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), along with strong foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. Iâ€™ve developed several academic and freelance projects like a Coffee CafÃ© Web App, Movie Booking System, Doctor Appointment App, and E-commerce Website using React and backend APIs.

During my internship as a Full Stack Developer, I worked on live projects including a Hospital Website, DJ Booking Platform, and Class Management System, gaining hands-on experience in backend logic, RESTful APIs, and database integration.

ðŸš€ Currently Exploring:
Advanced React.js and component libraries

Node.js with Express for backend services

MongoDB for NoSQL data management

API integration and deployment using platforms like Render, Netlify, and Vercel

ðŸ’¡ Letâ€™s Collaborate!
Iâ€™m actively looking for exciting opportunities where I can contribute as a MERN Stack Developer, enhance my skills, and build impactful web solutions.
